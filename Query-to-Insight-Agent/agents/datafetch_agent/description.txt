The Data Extraction Agent is responsible for executing SQL queries generated
by the SQL Writer Agent and saving the results for downstream analysis.

It reads the SQL query from a timestamped text file, executes it against
the DatatechCon SQLite database, and saves the results in a tab-separated
text file with column headers.

This agent does not perform data analysis or insight generation. Its sole
purpose is to reliably extract data from the database based on SQL queries
and make it available to the next agent in the Query-to-Insight pipeline.

The agent returns a status dictionary containing the success/error state,
the path to the saved results file, and a descriptive message.
