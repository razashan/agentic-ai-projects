The Analysis Agent is responsible for performing business-level analysis
on data extracted by the Data Extraction Agent in the Query-to-Insight system.

It reads the tab-separated results file produced by the Data Extraction Agent
and performs calculations, aggregations, and rankings based on the user’s
intent. The agent supports analysis for intents including course sales,
enrollments, instructor performance, revenue, and general analytics.

The output of this agent is a timestamped text file containing the analysis
results in a clear, tabular, or summary format. The agent returns a status
dictionary containing the success/error state, the path to the saved results
file, and a descriptive message.

This agent does not access the database or generate SQL queries; it only
processes the data provided.
