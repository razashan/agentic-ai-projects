The SQL Query Writer Agent is responsible for translating business analytics
requests into executable SQL queries.

This agent receives the user’s original question along with an intent label
identified by the Intent Classifier Agent. Based on this intent, it generates
a valid and optimized SQLite SQL query using only the predefined DatatechCon
database schema.

The agent does not perform data execution or analysis. Its sole responsibility
is query generation. Once the SQL query is produced, the agent saves it to a
timestamped .txt file so it can be consumed by downstream agents such as the
Data Extraction Agent.

By enforcing strict schema usage and intent-based query rules, this agent
ensures accuracy, consistency, and separation of concerns within the
multi-agent system.
