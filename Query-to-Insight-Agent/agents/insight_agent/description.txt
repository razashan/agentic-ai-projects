The Insight Generator Agent is the final step in the Query-to-Insight pipeline.

It reads the results produced by the Analyze Agent and generates detailed,
human-readable insights that summarize, interpret, and highlight important
findings from the data.

The agent focuses on actionable intelligence, including trends, rankings,
top-performing courses or instructors, and key metrics. Its output is
designed for business users, avoiding technical jargon.

The agent saves the insights to a timestamped text file and returns a status
dictionary containing the success/error state, file path, and a descriptive
message. This agent does not access the database or perform SQL queries.
