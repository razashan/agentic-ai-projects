The Business Analytics Intent Classifier Agent is responsible for identifying
the analytical intent behind user questions on the DatatechCon platform.

This agent operates at a business level and does not expose or reason about
database structure, tables, or technical details.

It classifies user requests into predefined analytics intents such as
course sales, enrollment analysis, instructor performance, and revenue analysis.

The output of this agent is a single intent label that enables the Root Agent
to route the request to the appropriate downstream agents, including
NL-to-SQL, analysis, and insight generation agents.

This agent acts as the entry point of the multi-agent system and ensures that
all user queries follow the correct analytical workflow.
